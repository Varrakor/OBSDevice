## OBS Scene Switcher

Load the program onto the Arduino Nano using the Arduino IDE, PlatformIO, or other application.

The python script requires a .env file located in the same directory.

Example .env contents:

```console
HOST=localhost
PORT=4455
PASSWORD=password # set in OBS app
SERIAL_PORT=/dev/cu.usbserial-1410 # can be found on Mac with > ls /dev/cu*
```
